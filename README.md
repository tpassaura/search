# Google Search Front-End

This project is a front-end implementation of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. It allows users to perform searches, view search results, and access advanced search options. The website is designed to resemble the aesthetics of Google's own interface.

## Pages

The website consists of the following pages:

1. **index.html**: Google Search page
2. **image.html**: Google Image Search page
3. **advanced.html**: Google Advanced Search page

## Features and Requirements

- The website should have a navigation bar at the top-right corner of each page, allowing users to switch between Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search pages.
- The Google Search page should have a centered search bar with rounded corners. The search button should be centered beneath the search bar.
- Users should be able to type a query into the search bar, click "Google Search," and be redirected to the Google search results page for that query.
- The Google Image Search page should allow users to type a query, click the search button, and be redirected to the Google Image search results page for that query.
- The Google Advanced Search page should provide input fields for the following search options:
  - "Find pages with... all these words:"
  - "Find pages with... this exact word or phrase:"
  - "Find pages with... any of these words:"
  - "Find pages with... none of these words:"
- The search options on the Advanced Search page should be stacked vertically, and the text fields should be left aligned.
- The "Advanced Search" button should have a blue background with white text, consistent with Google's own styling.
- Clicking the "Advanced Search" button should redirect the user to the search results page for the given query.
- The Google Search page should have an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. Clicking this button should take the user directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- Note: The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button may trigger a redirect notice due to Google's security feature. This is expected behavior.

## Files

The following files are included in the project:

- **index.html**: HTML file for the Google Search page
- **image.html**: HTML file for the Google Image Search page
- **advanced.html**: HTML file for the Google Advanced Search page
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the website
- **README.md**: Markdown file containing project information

## Usage

To use the website, simply open the desired HTML file in a web browser. You can navigate between the different pages using the navigation bar located at the top-right corner of each page.

## Implementation

The website is implemented using HTML and CSS. The HTML files contain forms with input fields and buttons, allowing users to input search queries and submit them. The CSS file is used to style the elements and make them resemble Google's interface.
